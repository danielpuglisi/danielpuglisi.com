    #   <p>
    #     I'm a swiss web developer with a weakness for
    #     design and typography. In 2011 I cofounded
    #     <a href='http://codegestalt.com'>Codegestalt</a>
    #     with two geeks I've met over Twitter. Since then
    #     we realized several projects together.
    #   </p>
    #   <p>
    #     My free time is sacrificed to improve my
    #     <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/danielpuglisi'>photography skills</a>
    #     and to extend my film and book horizon.
    #     You can find some recommendations
    #     <a href='/recommendations'>here</a>.

    #   <p>
    #     I do and like a lot of other stuff,
    #     but I'm afraid those things are only
    #     half as interesting as the things you just read.
    #     But if you would like to hear more of it anyway,
    #     read on or <a href='mailto:daniel@codegestalt.com'>contact me</a>.

    #     I've been designing and building web sites for over six years now & counting.
    #     When the sun is up I'm working for clients and when the sun is down I'm working
    #     on Codegestalt and personal projects like
    #     <a href='http://kreatify.com'>Kreatify</a> &
    #     <a href='http://bridgetalks.ch'>Bridge</a>.
    #   </p>
    #   <p>
    #     If you're interested in what I've done so far, switch over
    #     to the <a href='/work'>work</a> page. Also I feel the urge to
    #     open up myself from time to time, which outputs
    #     in a more or less useful blog post which you'll find in the <a href='/articles'>articles</a> section.

    #   <p>
    #     Since learning new stuff is essential in life and makes a lot of fun, I'm constantly pushing myself to new heights.
    #     I love to experiment with new things and always try to redefine myself. Sometimes with a combination of old and new things.
    #   </p>
    #   <p>
    #     Knowing certain things doesn't just come to you, you have to earn it yourself with constant effort and by always taking the next step.
    #     I love that feeling when that *click* happens and suddenly everything turns from blur to high definition.
    #   </p>
    #   <p>
    #     I can't get enough of building and creating stuff.
    #     So if you like what I do and need someone to help you,
    #     don't be shy and <a href='mailto:daniel@codegestalt.com'>contact me</a>.
    #     I would love to help you.
